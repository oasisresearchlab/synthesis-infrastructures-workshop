## Overview

Sharing, reuse, and synthesis of knowledge is central to the research process. These core functions are in theory served by the system of monographs, abstracts, and papers in journals and proceedings, with citation indices and search databases that comprise the core of our formal scholarly communication infrastructure; yet, converging lines of empirical and anecdotal evidence suggest that this system does not adequately act as infrastructure for synthesis. Emerging developments in new institutions for science, along with new technical infrastructures and tooling for decentralized knowledge work, offer new opportunities to prototype new technical infrastructures on top of a different installed base than the publish or perish, neoliberal academy. For more details, see the [Background section](#background) below.

This all-virtual, interactive workshop aims to integrate these developments and communities with CSCW's deep roots in knowledge infrastructures and collaborative and distributed sensemaking, with new developments in science institutions and tooling, to stimulate and accelerate progress towards prototyping new scholarly communication infrastructures that are actually optimized for sharing, reusing, and synthesizing knowledge. For more details, see the [Workshop Structure section](#workshop-structure) below.

Some examples of concrete topics we would like to work on together include (but are not limited to):
- "living" syntheses that respond appropriately to retracted, outdated, or inconsistent findings as knowledge bases evolve
- integrating formality and machine readability --- such as ontologies or semantic markup --- in graceful and appropriate ways that respect the limits of machine intelligence, and maintain diversity of perspectives, evidence, and epistemologies
- exposing granular, semantic forms of relationships between lines of work, such as argumentation patterns
- integrating tacit and contextual knowledge required for synthesis into more shareable knowledge infrastructures
- integrating novel forms of scholarly authorship and knowledge sharing into everyday individual and collaborative scholarly practices and workflows; novel assemblages, bricolages, and repurposing of existing tooling to enable these integrations
- the role of AI and machine learning systems in assisting --- vs. automating --- the construction of new synthesis-optimized knowledge sharing infrastructures
- the role of decentralized peer-to-peer technologies, and new developments in hypertext and personal knowledge graphs, in lowering barriers to community-owned and maintained syntheses of scientific knowledge
- applications and design patterns from crowdsourcing and social computing for new forms of scholarly communication infrastructure

## Workshop Structure

This all-virtual workshop will be structured around **synchronous and asynchronous work sessions in working groups**. This will include scheduled time to form and refine proposals, and short lightning talks about concrete proposals for artifacts to create, such as new syntheses/aggregations of resources and research theories and findings, pilot user studies and prototypes with novel tooling, and new designs and lo-fi prototypes. We will also schedule for an extended synchronous session at the end of the workshop to share progress, with ample time for discussion, feedback, and planning of next steps. We plan to organize **a venue for invited publication of the mature results of the collaborations**, approximately 3-6 months after the conclusion of the workshop. We envision the venue being a combination of community-owned open access publications, such as on PubPub, and a co-authored overview article in a more traditional publication such as CSCW or CACM.

### Submission and pre-workshop activities

Prospective participants will submit proposed materials by mid-September, and receive notifications by late September. Pre-workshop activities, including commenting and iterating on materials, as well as initial formation of working groups, in the github repository and over our hosted chat platform, will begin in the month of October.

### Workshop Schedule

We plan to limit synchronous joint sessions to ~3 hours in the morning of US East timezone, to maximize overlap in schedules across Asia, Europe, and the US. **This schedule will be adjusted as needed based on the final set of participants.** 

To maximize informal and spontaneous interactions, we plan to host the workshop on gather.town. All sessions will also be recorded and shared with participants to allow for continued participation if time zones conflict.

The following is a proposed rough schedule (in US Eastern time). 

**Day 1:**
- 09:30 - 09:40 - Welcome and kickoff
- 09:40 - 10:10 - Working groups finalize proposals
- 10:10 - 11:40 - Work sprint 1
- 11:40 - 12:25 - Working group proposal lightning talks
- Various times (depending on time zone): Work sprint 2

**Day 2:**
- 09:30 - 12:30 - Working group proposal progress reports and discussion
- 12:40 - 12:50 - Closing call to action, next steps

## Call for Participants

Given the time constraints and goals of producing and sharing work outputs, we are looking for 20-30 participants (to aim for no more than 5-6 working groups) to join this workshop.

We invite prospective participants to submit materials for consideration, appropriate for their background and interests: 
- **researchers** should submit a short summary of their past relevant research, and/or detailed annotated bibliographies;
- **tool-builders** should submit video demos, and/or links to learn and try out their tools; 
- **practitioners** should submit case studies of their attempts to shift practice (along with problems and opportunities/solutions they have discovered), and/or training materials for practice innovations, and example datasets. 

We invite participants to self-identify along these broad categories, according to how they wish to participate in the workshop.

Submissions will be accepted at the following [submission form](https://forms.gle/UfDgy8PsAeQkqLX8A).

These submissions will be considered by the organizers according to criteria of relevance for the core workshop themes, as well as balance across communities of research, tooling, and practice. Accepted submissions will then be curated into a shared github repository of materials. Prior to the workshop, participants will comment on and iterate on the ideas and resources in the repository. The materials in this repository will serve as important context and resources to fuel impactful collaborative work during the workshop.

## Background

How do researchers, scholars, and scientists share, reuse, and synthesize knowledge? Alongside informal channels of communication such as personal communications and interactions [^menzelPlannedUnplannedScientific1959] [^craneInvisibleCollegesDiffusion1972], scholars today rely heavily on a central infrastructure of **scholarly publishing**: a system of monographs, abstracts, and papers in journals and proceedings, with citation indices and search databases overlaid on top that comprise the formal scholarly record. Through this scholarly communication infrastructure, scholars have access to a vast and rapidly growing literature, across disciplines --- on the order of hundreds of millions of documents accessible through just a few clicks and keystrokes from a single search engine --- from which they can draw to construct new knowledge. 

However, **this scholarly communication infrastructure is not acting as infrastructure for synthesis**. The term infrastructure is meant to evoke reliability, sustainability, and "smooth functioning" that enables people to focus on the task at hand instead of fussing over preparatory overhead [^edwardsUnderstandingInfrastructureDynamics2007] [^starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]. Instead of this smooth functioning, researchers in today's infrastructure resort to laborious "hacks" and workarounds to "mine" publications for what they need [^knightEnslavedTrappedData2019]. Search engines operate over documents and their metadata (authorship, date, publication outlet), not claims and their context and relationships; scholarly documents are primarily archived as unstructured text, often in PDFs. If researchers are lucky, they might come across a published synthesis that is both on topic, with sufficient coverage, and up to date; that would likely be difficult for interdisciplinary questions (e.g., public health policy, cybersecurity and misinformation, creativity and metascience), which are where synthesis is most needed! Researchers might also be able to piece together leads on papers and authors and verbal statements of key ideas from knowledgeable colleagues. Failing all this, they would need to do the laborious work of citation tracing, manually checking references because citation databases typically do not surface information about why and in what way scholarly works cite each other, and collecting documents through keyword searches and then screening first the titles and abstracts and then their full text, and then constructing their own database of claims and data, often in a bespoke system of notes, annotations, and spreadsheets.

While these hacks often work well enough for the task at hand, they are rarely transferred in systematic ways across projects and people, violating the dimensions of "reach or scope" and "embodiment of standards" of infrastructure [^starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]. These are also not "one-time" costs: scientific problems require many such queries, and likely spawn new queries as projects evolve and more is learned. It is unsurprising, then, that synthesis of prior literature in published works is often subpar: studies of literature reviews in doctoral dissertations [^lovittsMakingImplicitExplicit2007] [^holbrookInvestigatingPhDThesis2004] and even published papers [^alton-leeTroubleshooterChecklistProspective1998] [^mcphetresDecadeTheoryReflected2020] [^flemingCochraneNonCochraneSystematic2013] have found them frequently lacking key aspects of synthesis quality, such as critical engagement with and generative integration of prior work and theory. Similarly, systematic reviews are increasingly struggling to keep up with the pace of knowledge, with many becoming outdated soon after they are published [^shojaniaHowQuicklySystematic2007], but are rarely updated [^ervinMotivatingAuthorsUpdate2008].

In this workshop, we ask: **how might we design scholarly communication infrastructures that are actually optimized for sharing, reusing, and synthesizing knowledge?** And where might these issues intersect with CSCW, to stimulate fresh sociotechnical progress, as well as theoretical development within CSCW? This set of questions has deep roots within CSCW. For example, CSCW recently gave a lasting impact award to Star and Ruedhler’s classic study of worm scientists grappling with the design and implementation of a new knowledge sharing infrastructure [^starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996]. This line
of work has continued to the present, studying the collaborative, practical, and social work of constructing and maintaining scientific knowledge infrastructures [^thomerTransformingTaxonomicInterfaces2018] [^randallDistributedOntologyBuilding2011] [^youngInfrastructuringCrossDisciplinarySynthetic2017] [^ribesSociotechnicalStudiesCyberinfrastructure2010], yielding and developing powerful concepts such as boundary objects [^starStepsEcologyInfrastructure1996] and infrastructure [^ribesSociotechnicalStudiesCyberinfrastructure2010], and interacting with rich theories of situated and distributed cognition and organizational memory [^ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013]. Knowledge sharing in teams and organizations, too, are a central concern in CSCW [^ackermanAnswerGardenMerging1996] [^ackermanSharingKnowledgeExpertise2013], as are systems for peer production of knowledge, such as Wikipedia [^liItGoodBe2015]. There is also a related rich tradition of studying complex sensemaking in collaborative and distributed settings [^borgePatternsTeamProcesses2012] [^goyalEffectsSensemakingTranslucence2016] [^fisherDistributedSensemakingImproving2012] [^xiaoSensemakingChemtrailConspiracy2021], and social computing and human-machine systems for synthesis [^siangliulueIdeaHoundSelfsustainableIdea2016]  [^hahnKnowledgeAcceleratorBig2016], [^chanImprovingCrowdInnovation2016]. In the cognate field of library and information science, too, there are decades of standards and platform-level work on new scholarly communication infrastructures that incorporate more sophistical models of semantics and scientific argumentation to support synthesis [^shumScholOntoOntologybasedDigital2000] [^kuhnGenuineSemanticPublishing2017] [^dewaardProteinsFairytalesDirections2010].

We aim to stimulate fresh progress by bringing these deep roots into conversation with emerging trends in science and infrastructure reform and innovation. We are especially excited to engage with a range of new institutions for science that have recently emerged outside the academy, often deliberately structured to pursue different incentive structures. Some examples include the [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org/), a nonprofit organization that supports open collaboration and accessible mentorship for aspiring machine learning researchers both inside and outside the academy; [Invisible College](https://invisible.college/), a prototype distributed and collocated set of communities for independent researchers; and the [Arcadia Institute](https://www.arcadia.science/), a new bioscience research institute that is experimenting with completely open science workflows and micropublishing [^avasthiExperimentBeginsArcadia2022]; the [Citizens and Technology Lab](https://citizensandtech.org/about-cat-lab/), where online platform users and moderators co-create research on online communities with researchers from Cornell University; and [LabDAO](https://www.labdao.xyz/), an open, community-run network of wet and dry laboratory services for fueling decentralized collaborative research in the life sciences. These institutions are fueled in part by new coordination structures and technologies, including open-source community publishing platforms like [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/), and patterns from the emerging technology around Decentralized Science ([DAOs](https://www.freethink.com/science/decentralized-science)) and decentralized, content-addressed, peer-to-peer knowledge infrastructures, such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), and [local-first software](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) [^kleppmannLocalfirstSoftwareYou2019]. Co-evolving alongside these efforts are new experiments in science funding, from [crowdfunding](https://experiment.com/) to [larger investments](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/scientific-funding-is-broken-can-silicon-valley-fix-it/621295/) in creating new kinds of scientific institutes. Scientists are also increasingly experimenting with novel publication formats that are more tuned to synthesis, such as micropublishing or semantic publication of results [^bucurNanopublicationBasedSemanticPublishing2022]. The potential intersection of these communities and technological developments offers new opportunities to grow new technical infrastructures on top of a different installed base than the publish or perish, neoliberal academy. We aim for these new infrastructural patterns to synergize and combine with long-running advances and innovations in open science (sharing of code, data, and protocols) and open access and preprints. We hope this new wave of sociotechnical innovation will catalyze bottom-up evolution and growth towards new infrastructures for sharing, reusing, and synthesizing knowledge for the good of humanity.
